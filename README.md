Plant Seedlings Classification

* Project completed as part of Great Learning's Postgraduate Program - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
* Project delivered in April 2024
* Repository includes two files:
  * Jupyter notebook with Python code
  * CSV file includes data imported into notebook
 
# Problem Statement : Plant Seedlings Classification
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark, has provided the data containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species. You being a data scientist, need to build a Convolutional Neural Network model which would classify the plant seedlings into their respective 12 categories.

* Data Description

  * This dataset contains images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species.
  * The data file names are:
    * images.npy
    * Labels.csv
  * Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to numpy arrays and stored in images.npy file and the corresponding labels are also put into Labels.csv so that you can work on the data/project seamlessly without having to worry about the high data volume.
  * The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from an image.
